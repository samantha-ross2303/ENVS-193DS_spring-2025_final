## c. Suggestions for rewriting

# Problem 2. Data visualization

## a. Cleaning and summarizing

    ) |> 
  # keep only data from 2018 and later
  filter(year >= 2018) |> 
  # converting year to a factor with 6 levels
  mutate(year = as_factor(year), 
         year = fct_relevel(year,

  ungroup()

```

## b. Visualize the data

```{r visualize-the-data}

# starting with the clean data frame
ggplot(sst_clean,
       aes(x = month, # month on the x-axis 
           y = mean_monthly_sst, # mean monthly sea surface temp on the y-axis
           color = year, # color by year
           group = year)) + # group by year
  # creating a line plot with specified line size
  geom_line(linewidth = 1)+
  # adding points with a specified size
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  # customizing color gradient
  scale_color_brewer(
    palette = "Blues", # blue color gradient
    direction = "1" # light to dark
  ) +
  # changing axis and legend titles
  labs(
    x = "Month", # changing the name of the x-axis
    y = "Mean monthly sea surface temperature (Â°C)", # changing the name of the y-axis
    color = "Year" # changing the name of the legend
  ) +
  # changing the theme
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    panel.border = element_rect(color = "grey40", fill = NA), # adding a border
    panel.grid = element_blank(), # removing the grid
    legend.position = c(0.25, 0.75), # changing the position of the legend
    # changing the text sizes and colors
    legend.title = element_text(size = 14), 
    legend.text = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10, color = "grey40"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
    axis.ticks = element_line(color = "grey40") # adding ticks for the axes
  )

```

# Problem 3. Data analysis


# Problem 4. Affective and exploratory visualizations

## a. Comparing visualizations

The visualizations represent different data that I collected, in a way. The predictor variable in my affective visualization is the date (on the x-axis), and the response variable is distance ran/walked per day (on the y-axis) - since it is going in chronological order. There is an additional overlay of daily high temperature to demonstrate how temperature might influence the distance I walked/ran. In my exploratory visualizations, one examines distance walked/ran as a function of school day(yes/no), and the other examines distance walked/ran as a function of daily high temperature. All of the response variables are the distance walked/ran, but I use different predictor variables to examine the possible relationships and patterns. In my affective visualization, it is hard to see patterns because the predictor variable is date. Although, the day I walk the least was also the hottest, and the days I walked the most were mild/warm temperatures (which is subjective to my personal beliefs about temperature). In my categorical exploratory visualization, I can see that the median walking/running distance is similar for both school days and non-school days. In my continuous exploratory visualization, I can see that there is a slight increase in walking/running distance as temperature increases - but I have not ran the tests to confirm. However, the day I walked the least was also the hottest - an outlier. These patterns are different between visualizations because they involve different predictor variables. Unfortunately I was sick and did not attend workshop in week 9. I got full points for my affective visualization in homework 3, so I did not make any changes before workshop week 10. To advance this visualization, I would like to recreate it on paper, so that I can make it more aesthetically pleasing. 

## b. Sharing your affective visualization

Attended week 10 workshop!
